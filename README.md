# Pygame Aimtrainer - Readme

This is a simple 2d aimtrainer I made using Pygame as a way of learning the Pygame library. Refer to my [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/E-lZnliilaY) for gameplay demo. 

The game has the following features:
1. Two game modes: Reaction training and flicking training
2. Background music in main menu
3. Custom crosshair
4. Gunshot sound for each click
5. Accuracy and time taken displayed at the end of the game mode

I am also currently working on implementing mouse sensitivity. Any ideas would be welcome.
